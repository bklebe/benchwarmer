Benchwarmer
===========

Benchwarmer is an Elixir micro-benchmarking utility that runs a function (or
list of functions) repeatedly against a dataset for a period of time, and then
reports on the average time each operation took to complete, allowing for easy
comparison.

Benchwarmer was inspired by the built-in benchmark operations in the Go
test library.
